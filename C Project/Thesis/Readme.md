# Thesis Project

This is my thesis project titled "Design Subsystem of Telecommunication (TTC-Telemetry, Tracking, and Command) Based on Microcontroller for Nano-Satellite UGMSat-1".
I'm using PIC16F877A as microcontroller and C programming language to programming it using MPLAB X IDE. 
This project's aim is to process the command from ground station (computer) and send housekeeping data from OBDH subsystem to ground station.
